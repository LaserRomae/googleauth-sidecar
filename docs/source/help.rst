Troubleshooting
===============

If the container isn't working as you expect, enable DEBUG logging in the ``Logger`` class under ``src/app/utils.py`` to help understand what is going on under the hood and why.

	``self.logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)``

Tests
=====

A set of tests is included in ``src/test``. To run the tests, just invoke

	``python src/test/unittests.py``
